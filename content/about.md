About page will go here, for now, read the introductory blog post on https://zeus.ugent.be/blog/23-24/open-source-esp32-wifi-mac/

This is a sizeable project that could definitely use multiple contributors; I'd really like to collaborate with other people to create a fully functional, open-source Wi-Fi stack for the ESP32. If this sounds like something you'd like to work on, contact me via <a href="mailto:esp32-open-mac@devreker.be">esp32-open-mac@devreker.be</a>, maybe we can have a weekly hacking session?

As far as I know, this is the first undertaking to build an open source 802.11 MAC for an affordable microcontroller. If you want to financially support this project, you can wire money via <https://zeus.ugent.be/contact/#payment-info>, please put "ESP32" in the transaction description, so the treasurer knows what the money is for. Please do not donate if you're a student or if you're not financially independent. If you're a company and would like to donate hardware (for example, filters for a faraday cage or measuring equipment that might be useful), please contact me.

[This project](https://nlnet.nl/project/ESP32-opendrivers/) was funded through the [NGI0 Core Fund](https://nlnet.nl/core/), a fund established by NLnet with financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology under grant agreement No 101092990.
